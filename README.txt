Please refer to Three-Manual.pdf (in Swedish) for further instructions.

You need at least Ruby 1.9.3 to run <3 source files.

The following command will run your program:
ruby 3.rb

You will then be asked to specify the file name of your source code.

Please give your source code file the extension .three   

There is an example file called 3.three

Three you later!
